## Tips

- Don't over exert yourself. This ought to be fun. Make sure to get plenty of sleep, feed yourself, and to take regular breaks to rest your eyes and stretch. Once every hour should be enough. Set an alarm if it helps.
- Assign responsibilities and let them go. Don't micromanage your teammates, trust in them to deliver, if they don't, that's also ok. It's all part of the process.
- There is no winning or losing, you're either learning or not. Failing is also a part of learning.
- Learn ONE(1) thing at a time. Don't try to learn coding, art, music, writing, etc... in a single jam. You'll just frustrate yourself. If you're a programmer, use premade assets. If you're an artist or a designer, use tools that are codelite or have friendly programming languages. Rely on your teammate's skills, and if they have no skills, that's great! That means they get to pick one and work on it for the rest of the jam.
